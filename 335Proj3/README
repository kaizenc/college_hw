## How to run

Instructions

## Running Log

# Monday, April 16

Began the subway project, mainly just getting the header files finished and cleaned up

# Thursday, April 19

Began writing down functions and the way classes should be organized. I'm starting to get an understanding of how these classes talk to each other.

# Thursday, May 3

Slow progress, just writing down the easy parts of the code so I'm not completely lost when I work on this project later.

# Thursday, May 10

Haven't been coding much, but I finished up subway_entrance. A lot of work is being done just to figure out what I need.
