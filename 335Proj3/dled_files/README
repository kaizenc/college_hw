subway_entrances_orig.csv is the downloaded data file, without the column
headings, with invalid line fields, some lower-case, some missing names,
and duplicate names as well.

subway_entrances_cleaned.csv differs from the original in that:
1. there are no null names
2. names are now unique
3. all line field data is in upper-case and in the correct format

The names were made unique by appending a digit to the end of the string
when there were more two or more names that were the same.

There are now two files in this directory, command.o and command.h, to
make it easier for you to complete this project. command.o implements the
interface in command.h and can be linked into your program. The command.h
interface provides methods to read and parse the command file for the project.
It is similar to the same-named files of the preceding projects.
